## ðŸ“˜ What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?

In TypeScript, both `interface` and `type` can be used to define the structure of data, but they have different capabilities and use cases.

---

### 1. **Extending and Composition**

- **Interface** supports extension using `extends`:
  ```ts
  interface Person {
    name: string;
  }

  interface Employee extends Person {
    id: number;
  }

- **Types** uses intersection types (&) for composition:
```ts
  type Person = {
    name: string;
  };
  type Employee = Person & {
    id: number;
  };
```

### 2. **Use with Primitives and Unions**
- **Type** can define union types and primitives:
```ts
type ID = number | string;
```

### 3. **Prefered Use**
- Use **interface** when describing object shapes, especially for classes or public APIs.
- Use **type** when working with advanced or complex types like unions, tuples, or mapped types.



## ðŸ”‘ What is the use of the `keyof` keyword in TypeScript? Provide an example.

The `keyof` keyword in TypeScript is used to create a **union of the property names (keys)** of a given type.

---

### Why use `keyof`?

- To extract the keys of an object type
- To enforce that only valid keys are used in functions, lookups, etc.
- To support better type checking and auto-completion

---

### Example:

```ts
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  isStudent: boolean;
};

type PersonKeys = keyof Person; 
// Equivalent to: "name" | "age" | "isStudent"
